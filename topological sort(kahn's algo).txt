for a directed acyclic graph topological sort is ....for every edge uv which is from u to v ...u comes before v...as simple as that.

FEEL❤❤❤❤: jiski indegree sabse kam rahegi means wo sabse kam dependent hai kisi aur pe ...hence sorting me wo sabse pahle aayega.
(coz independent log jyada powerful hote hain....like singles are happier than mingle😅.)

indegree means jab koi edge ghus rahi vertex me to usko indegree bolenge.
