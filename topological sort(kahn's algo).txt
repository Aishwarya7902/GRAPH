for a directed acyclic graph topological sort is ....for every edge uv which is from u to v ...u comes before v...as simple as that.

FEEL‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§: jiski indegree sabse kam rahegi means wo sabse kam dependent hai kisi aur pe ...hence sorting me wo sabse pahle aayega.
(coz independent log jyada powerful hote hain....like singles are happier than mingleüòÖ.)

indegree means jab koi edge ghus rahi vertex me to usko indegree bolenge.

PESUDO CODE FOR TOPOLOGICAL SORT
1.sabki indegree nikal lo  ( use vector)
2.jiski bhi indegree 0 hai usko q me dal do
while(!q.empty())
3.ek temp variable me q ke front ko store kar lo
4.print /ans me add kar lo
5.is vertex se jitne v connected edges hai unko indegree-- karo.....if it also comes to be 0 then push into queue
6.at last return ans vector

Note: if no of elements in topological sort is less than total no of vertices initially in the graph ...it means ki graph has cycle.
