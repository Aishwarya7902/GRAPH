hai kya?ðŸ¤”
to dekho bhai 
for any directed acyclic graph
for any vertex u->v...... in toposort u should come before v and this should hold true for every vertex
 
 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:

let say tumhe koi course padhna hai....quantum physics padhne se pahle tumhe classical physics aani chahiye ....classical physics se pahle tumhe basic science 
aani chahiye

graph here
basic science->classical phy->quantum phy

hence topo sort will be :basic science ,classical phy,quantum phy
